### Joseph Clinic Mission Center

**Purpose of Establishment**

Joseph Clinic is a medical institution and non-profit organizatiothat provides charitable medical care to the poor and sick. It was established by the late Fr. Choi YoungSik, Mathias, outside of Manila in the Philippines in 2013. It follows the Joseph Clinic's ideology of "Caring for the poor and helpless patients with the love of Christ and providing the best assistance for their self-support."

Fr. Kim DaSol, James, operates the clinic as the second director according to the mission of "the best free medical care for the poor."

**Mission Statement**

Helping poor and helpless neighbors is the practice of the teachings of Jesus Christ and the mission of Christians. Today the church has declared: "The joys and the hopes, the grief and the anxieties of the men of this age, especially those who are poor or in any way afflicted, these are the joys and hopes, the griefs and anxieties of the followers of Christ." (Section 1, The Pastoral Constitution, Second Vatican Council).

Just helping them and asking for the blessing of God is what we do to show faithfulness to Christ. The Philippines Joseph Clinic is one of many places to convey God's blessings.

### Our Lady of Lujan Mission Center Mercy Homes

**Purpose of Establishment**

 The Our Lady of Lujan Mission Center, Mercy Homes for Girls, is run by Mother Cristo Pobre as its mother superior. The orphans are mostly from Tacloban City, Philippines, who got orphaned because of the strong typhoon "Yolanda", which destroyed houses and properties and left a great number of lives killed by its strong winds and huge rain. RCMFS brought rice, groceries, and other goodies for the orphans and the sisters and wished them a great Christmas celebration. The orphans on the other hand offered us some few songs and their commitment to pursue their studies so that they in turn will be 
able to contribute for the betterment of people and society.
